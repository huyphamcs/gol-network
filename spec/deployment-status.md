# GOL deployment status

Last reviewed: 10 September 2026

## Current state

`gol.network` runs the KMS-backed agent signer. The application is live (not fixture mode) at
`https://gol.network` on the Tokyo EC2 instance `gol-production`, serving source commit
`eeb5596028b2e652508d48646f84909391356548` (adds the mocked Tokenized Stocks tab at
`/tokenized-stocks` for the Base hackathon; client-only, no runtime, API, env, or schema change
from `a2b4af4`). `/api/health` reports
`signer.provider = aws_kms`, `signer.ready = true`, and `ready = true`. The payment worker derives
the agent address from the production KMS key on startup and refuses to run on any mismatch. The web
container carries no AWS SDK and no AWS credentials.

The Tokenized Stocks tab is an explicitly labeled mock: it shows a "MOCK UI" banner, builds its
market, portfolio, mandate, and audit log in the browser on each load, reaches no API route, and is
never evidence. The Arc testnet workflow at `/` is unchanged.

There is one shared agent address for all users (spec section 6.1 initial model). `AGENT_GAS_MANAGED`
is `true`: the operator funds the shared agent EOA's native Arc gas and the owner is never asked to
top it up. This changes no trust boundary; below `AGENT_GAS_LOW_WATERMARK` the worker still refuses
to sign (`signer_blocked` / `AGENT_GAS_INSUFFICIENT`).

Still pending: the mandatory real-user browser acceptance on `gol.network` (spec section 10.3). No
owner-signed mandate for the KMS agent exists yet, so no allowed or refused payment has executed
under the new signer in production. Until that passes, do not state that users can send funds under
an owner-signed mandate on `gol.network`.

This file is the operational source of truth for the remaining release work. Check an item only when
the named evidence exists; configuration presence or fixture output is not acceptance.

## KMS-backed agent signer cutover (9 September 2026)

Implements [KMS-backed agent signer specification](kms-backed-agent-signer-spec.md).

- [x] Provider-neutral signer, AWS KMS implementation, mandatory pre-sign envelope validator, and
      the persist-before-broadcast worker state machine are implemented with unit and crash-window
      tests. `pnpm --filter @gol/agent test` 69 passed / 3 skipped (Postgres integration skipped);
      `pnpm --filter @gol/web test` 18 passed; both typecheck and build; `forge test` 20 passed;
      `pnpm format:check` and `git diff --check` clean. Node 22.22.0, pnpm 11.17.0.
- [x] Production KMS signing key created: `alias/gol-agent-signer-production`,
      `arn:aws:kms:ap-northeast-1:779035457064:key/54cbfcbc-eaae-4ac8-9c76-41477ec38567`,
      `ECC_SECG_P256K1` / `SIGN_VERIFY` / `ECDSA_SHA_256`, CUSTOMER managed, tagged
      (project, environment, owner, purpose, created).
- [x] Derived agent address `0x17A1DEfca6BA7BD1f14d6585eD34c14f69ab08eE`, confirmed byte-for-byte by
      three independent implementations (agent SPKI parser + viem, `viem/accounts` publicKeyToAddress,
      Foundry `cast keccak`).
- [x] Worker IAM: customer-managed policy `GOLAgentSignerKMS` grants only `kms:GetPublicKey` and
      `kms:Sign` (conditioned `kms:SigningAlgorithm = ECDSA_SHA_256`) on the exact key ARN, with an
      explicit Deny on `DisableKey`, `ScheduleKeyDeletion`, `PutKeyPolicy`, `CreateGrant`, and alias
      management. Attached to `GOLProductionEC2Role`. Verified from the instance role:
      `kms:GetPublicKey` and `kms:Sign` (ECDSA_SHA_256) succeed; `ECDSA_SHA_384` and
      `kms:ScheduleKeyDeletion` return `AccessDenied`.
- [x] Web credential boundary: `AWS_EC2_METADATA_DISABLED=true` on the `web` service and the web
      image contains no `@aws-sdk` (`ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`). The worker holds no static AWS keys and
      uses the instance role over IMDS (hop limit 2, IMDSv2 required).
- [x] CloudTrail: multi-region trail `gol-audit`, log-file validation, S3
      `gol-cloudtrail-779035457064` (public access blocked, versioned, 400-day lifecycle) and
      CloudWatch Logs `/gol/cloudtrail` (400-day retention). Metric-filter alarms
      `gol-kms-key-lifecycle` and `gol-kms-sign-volume-high` publish to SNS `gol-security-alerts`
      (email subscription pending confirmation). `GetPublicKey` and `Sign` by the worker are
      recorded.
- [x] Verified Postgres backup taken before cutover:
      `s3://gol-production-779035457064-ap-northeast-1/postgres/20260909T143142Z-pre-kms-cutover.sql.gz`.
- [x] Additive schema migration applied on production (idempotent `ALTER TABLE`; `signing_prepared`
      and `signed` states; `account_links` signer_* columns; nullable Privy identifiers).
- [x] `deploy/deploy.sh` re-run at `RELEASE_COMMIT=30cf569…`; web and worker images rebuilt on
      Node 22 ARM64; migration applied; `/api/health` returned 200 with `signer.ready = true`.
- [x] The single existing `account_links` row (owner `0x6B745CFFD0018d910FA1C00911ebc2fd19933f55`,
      account `0xD7425769803302430B343fAa410c34A3DF9908Af`) was migrated from `privy` to `aws_kms`
      with the derived KMS address; historical `agent_wallet_id` / `policy_id` retained. Its three
      prior requests are terminal `unknown` (`SUBMISSION_AMBIGUOUS`, no `tx_hash`) and are not
      re-claimed.
- [x] Worker end-to-end `kms:Sign` over a DIGEST returned an `ECDSA_SHA_256` DER signature.
- [x] `AGENT_GAS_MANAGED=true` deployed (commit `4ef2c3f`): the owner gas top-up step is hidden and
      the operator funds the shared agent EOA.
- [ ] Operator funds the shared agent address `0x17A1DEfca6BA7BD1f14d6585eD34c14f69ab08eE` with a
      small native Arc gas reserve and adds a balance alarm on it.
- [ ] Owner reviews and signs a fresh mandate naming `0x17A1DEfca6BA7BD1f14d6585eD34c14f69ab08eE`.
- [ ] `pnpm demo:acceptance` (or the browser flow) executes one allowed 40 USDC payment and one
      refused 70 USDC payment under the KMS signer, with Graph and grounded-answer evidence.
- [ ] Real-user browser acceptance on `gol.network` per spec section 10.3, evidence saved.
- [ ] Confirm the SNS `gol-security-alerts` email subscription.

## 1. Release source

- [ ] Push the intended release commit and record its full hash.
- [ ] Run the complete validation suite from a clean checkout with Node 22 and pnpm 11.17.0.
- [ ] Run the PostgreSQL-enabled agent tests with `TEST_DATABASE_URL` and record the result.
- [ ] Repeat the ARM64 image builds, migration/role check, backup/restore drill, and worker fail-closed
      container check after the latest runtime and Compose changes.
- [ ] Record the release commit in the deployed services as `GOL_SOURCE_COMMIT`.

Evidence:

- Release commit:
- Validation record:
- Image digests:

## 2. Provider and infrastructure provisioning

- [x] Create or confirm the dedicated Privy application, allowed origin, app secret, verification
      key, and authorization key/quorum.
- [x] Confirm the authorization key ID matches the configured private authorization key.
- [x] Obtain and verify access to the configured OpenAI model.
- [x] Create the Graph Studio subgraph, deploy key, query API key, and endpoint.
- [x] Confirm the production host, region, architecture, capacity, encrypted storage, and SSM or
      restricted SSH access. Create or explicitly approve a replacement if `gol-production` does
      not exist.
- [x] Configure DNS, TLS, the private backup bucket, KMS key, IAM role, and retention policy.
- [ ] Populate `deploy/.env.production` on the host with mode `0600`; never commit it.

Evidence:

- Privy app and policy IDs: app `cmttquzfy02qb09l5gd9u6txw` (`Gol`); authorization
  quorum `yeb2ndtfydr87r4687k4ypyv` (`GOL worker signer`, threshold 1). Allowed
  origins `https://gol.network` and `http://127.0.0.1:3000`. Policy ID is created
  per owner during agent provisioning, not at app setup.
- Graph Studio subgraph: slug `gol`, Studio account `1758918`, network Arc testnet.
  Studio status still `DRAFT` (not published to the decentralised network). Query API
  key `gol-production` created and stored as `GRAPH_API_KEY`. Dev query endpoint live
  after deploying version `0.0.1`:
  `https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/1758918/gol/0.0.1`. Deploy key and query API
  key are distinct 32-hex values; deploy key held only in `../.secrets/gol-graph.env`.
- Production host and region: `i-0551fb8ae101f65d0`, `ap-northeast-1` / `ap-northeast-1d`, `t4g.medium` ARM64,
  Amazon Linux 2023, 30 GB encrypted gp3, Elastic IP `16.76.174.242`, SSH alias
  `gol-production`, SSM Online
- Public domain: `gol.network` (Cloudflare DNS-only A record to the Elastic IP; Caddy
  Let's Encrypt certificate for `https://gol.network`)
- Backup bucket and KMS reference: `gol-production-779035457064-ap-northeast-1` /
  `alias/gol-backups`

## 3. Arc contract deployment

- [x] Load the Foundry keystore account `gol-deployer`
      (`0xD2DA4968B09401DB75517EF9AcF6A30CdC7dF26F`) without exposing its password or key.
- [x] Confirm Arc testnet chain ID `5042002`, official USDC, deployer balance, and compiler settings.
- [x] Deploy `GolAccountFactory` with `contracts/script/Deploy.s.sol`.
- [x] Verify the contract source on the configured Arc explorer.
- [x] Update `deployments/arc-testnet.json` with the factory address, deployment block and
      transaction, source commit, bytecode and ABI hashes, and verification URL.
- [ ] Create the demonstration account through the verified factory and record its address.

Evidence:

- Factory address: `0x229db99428ae031819cF6acF3c056588c4283B2F`
- Account address: pending creation by the actual owner wallet
- Deployment transaction and block:
  `0x4ddb59a2ce2d9e6a2d358593462f301be1d844175148888798fdb579d0baf7fc`, block
  `61883600`
- Verification URL:
  https://testnet.arcscan.app/address/0x229db99428ae031819cF6acF3c056588c4283B2F
- Source commit: `62076310bb3efb7b75be15add5ed3bff26a8cfd1`
- Bytecode hash: `0x97ba888934fbb0f7ad0b79503cbffe1869cb57764ad88335cf01558280e6cc76`
- ABI hash: `0x34996f274c68002fde4c9a782b02747006b25e05898efc4a50f2311af8ba45f6`
- Contract validation: 19 Foundry tests passed; `forge fmt --check` passed

## 4. Subgraph deployment

- [x] Run `pnpm subgraph:prepare` from the completed Arc deployment manifest.
- [x] Review the generated network, factory address, and start block.
- [x] Run subgraph code generation, tests, and build.
- [ ] Deploy a new subgraph version through Graph Studio and record its deployment ID and query
      endpoint.
- [ ] Confirm `_meta` health and that the new version indexes from the replacement factory block.

Evidence:

- Prepared manifest: network `arc-testnet`, factory
  `0x229db99428ae031819cF6acF3c056588c4283B2F`, `startBlock: 61883600` (matches
  `deployments/arc-testnet.json` deployment block).
- Build/test: `graph codegen` and `graph build` clean on `@graphprotocol/graph-cli`
  0.98.1 / Node 22; `graph test` 3/3 matchstick assertions pass.
- Prepared build: `graph codegen`, `graph test` (3/3), and `graph build` pass for the
  replacement factory.
- Currently deployed legacy version: deployment ID
  `QmYuyvng3hazXSfj3MWnFi2arm6RCJu4FD2nstF52xSYT9`, version label `0.0.1`.
- Current legacy query endpoint, without API key:
  `https://api.studio.thegraph.com/query/1758918/gol/0.0.1`
- Legacy `_meta` health: `hasIndexingErrors: false`; deployment hash matches the CID above;
  indexed head past block `61202900`, i.e. synced beyond the factory deployment block
  `61179889`.
- Replacement deployment remains pending because the Graph Studio deploy credential is not
  available on this machine. Until it is deployed, the current endpoint does not index accounts
  created by factory `0x229db99428ae031819cF6acF3c056588c4283B2F`.

## 5. Application deployment

- [ ] Deploy PostgreSQL, the web service, payment worker, and Caddy with `deploy/deploy.sh`.
- [ ] Confirm PostgreSQL has no public host port and that web and worker use restricted runtime
      credentials.
- [ ] Confirm HTTPS and `/api/health` report the expected source commit, database connectivity, Arc
      chain, and Graph health.
- [ ] Configure Privy allowed origins for the final HTTPS domain.
- [ ] Schedule encrypted off-host backups and complete an isolated restore drill.
- [ ] Restart the host or containers and verify journal recovery, persistent data, TLS, and worker
      health.
- [ ] Rehearse rollback with a compatible earlier release without deleting `postgres_data`.

Evidence:

- Health response:
- Backup URI and restore result:
- Restart/recovery record:
- Rollback record:

## 6. Wallet and policy setup

- [ ] Fund the owner wallet with sufficient Arc testnet USDC for setup and gas.
- [ ] Sign in through the real Privy owner flow and link the deployed GOL account.
- [ ] Provision the separate agent wallet and restricted signer policy.
- [ ] Run `pnpm preflight` successfully.
- [ ] Run `GOL_POLICY_PROBE=1 pnpm policy:probe`; record the allowed GOL transaction and the
      wrong-destination denial before broadcast.
- [ ] Fund the agent gas reserve and GOL account with the required demonstration balances.
- [ ] Review and sign a fresh seven-day, one-recipient, 100 USDC mandate.
- [ ] Verify owner withdrawal and revocation controls before preparing the final fresh mandate.

Evidence:

- Owner, agent, and recipient public addresses:
- Privy policy ID:
- Allowed probe transaction:
- Denied probe result:
- Final mandate ID:

## 7. Live acceptance

- [ ] Run `pnpm demo:acceptance` against a fresh 100 USDC mandate.
- [ ] Confirm the 40 USDC request is executed with an Arc receipt.
- [ ] Confirm the subsequent 70 USDC request is a successful on-chain `CUMULATIVE_CAP` refusal with
      60 USDC headroom.
- [ ] Confirm The Graph indexes both request IDs and transaction hashes without duplication.
- [ ] Confirm Ask the Record explains the refusal using trusted indexed and explorer citations.
- [ ] Measure indexing delay and exercise stale, unavailable, provider-failure, and recovery states.
- [ ] Save the acceptance JSON tied to the deployed source commit and public URL.
- [ ] Rehearse the complete flow from a clean, signed-out browser.

Evidence:

- Acceptance JSON:
- Executed transaction:
- Refused transaction:
- Indexed action IDs:
- Answer citations:
- Measured indexing delay:

## 8. Release and submission evidence

- [ ] Capture at least three clean-browser screenshots from the deployed application.
- [ ] Record actual feedback and human design decisions in `FEEDBACK.md`.
- [ ] Replace every placeholder in `spec/submission-copy.md` with verified live evidence.
- [ ] Confirm registration, track and prize selections, form constraints, and asset dimensions in the
      authenticated dashboard.
- [ ] Record, upload, and watch the complete two-to-four-minute human-narrated video.
- [ ] Publish the source and live demo URLs and perform the final human submission.

Evidence:

- Screenshot paths:
- Feedback record:
- Video URL:
- Source URL:
- Live demo URL:
- Submission acknowledgement:

## Known caveats

- GOL is Arc testnet only, unaudited, and not represented as mainnet-ready.
- The Privy signer policy constrains the transaction envelope; it is not an ABI-level allowlist.
- A fixture walkthrough proves UI behavior only. It does not prove Arc, Privy, The Graph, OpenAI,
  production hosting, or partner eligibility.
- Live integration may expose provider or chain compatibility defects that require implementation
  changes before acceptance can pass.
